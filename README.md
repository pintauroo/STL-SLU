# STL-SLU

Welcome to Your Adventure in Saint Louis!  
In this post, we will share information about the city, the campus, and more.

## Where Should I Live in STL?

Ideally, you’ll want to live near the campus, preferably not farther than the Central West End (CWE) area. This area is easily accessible by bus or bike. Some buildings have specific move-in and move-out periods, as they are mostly student housing. My recommendations are:

- **Coronado Place and Towers:** Single rooms ($1000, excluding amenities) / Double rooms ($800, excluding amenities). Roommates are assigned for double rooms.
- **The Icon:** Single rooms ($1000, including amenities) / Double rooms ($750, including amenities). Roommates are assigned for double rooms.
- **3949 Apartments:** Single rooms ($1300, including amenities) / Double rooms ($850, excluding amenities). Roommates are assigned for double rooms.
- **Airbnb:** You might find good deals on shared apartments.

## How Do You Get Around the City?

In the U.S., many people use Uber, which is affordable, especially when you split the fare with friends. For daily commutes to school, Saint Louis offers the MetroLink train line and a bus line. Tickets cost $2.50 for the train and $1 for the bus, available through the Transit app.

If you enjoy biking, I recommend getting a bike, as it makes it much easier to move around at your convenience.

## Is Saint Louis Safe?

Like any city, Saint Louis has its pros and cons when it comes to safety. Overall, it is safe if you're aware of your surroundings and know which neighborhoods to explore. It's important to familiarize yourself with the areas that are considered safe, especially if you're new to the city. Central West End, Clayton, and the Delmar Loop are generally safe and popular places to visit. As with any urban area, it's a good idea to avoid certain parts of the city at night and stay informed about your surroundings.

## What Mobile Carrier Should I Choose?

In the U.S., mobile plan prices can be quite high, so it's important to find a carrier that offers good value for your needs. One of the best options for affordable mobile plans is **Mint Mobile**. They offer some of the most budget-friendly plans while still providing reliable service.

With Mint Mobile, you can choose prepaid plans for 3, 6, or 12 months at a time, which helps keep costs down. Their plans typically include unlimited talk and text, and various data options ranging from 5GB to unlimited, depending on what you need. The longer you commit (e.g., a 12-month plan), the cheaper your monthly rate becomes. Mint Mobile operates on the T-Mobile network, so you'll have solid nationwide coverage. Plus, they often have promotions for new users, making it a great choice for anyone looking to save money while still getting decent service.
